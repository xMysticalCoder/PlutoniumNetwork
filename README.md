# PlutoniumNetwork
Welcome to [PlutoniumNetwork](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/658854833/), the safe browser made by Scratchers, for Scratchers.

Features:
- Website creation
- Website editing
- Website viewing
- Custom advertisements
- Shows weather

Why is the browser safe?
PlutoniumNetwork is safe because all websites are automatically moderated by Scratch since the only way to make websites is using comments. The advertisements are also created the same way.

Some stats:
You can have 4999 websites (or ~50mb worth of websites, depending on which comes first) and 5mb worth of advertisements!

For reference, 1mb is 1,048,576 characters and the max characters 1 advertisement/website can hold is 128.
